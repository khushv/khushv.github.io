I wanted to solidify my knowledge of AWS I had gained in my previous life as a developer and largely I felt it gave me a breadth, but not depth overview .of all the different services AWS had to offer. Since then, I’ve lead an... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>T1055 - Basics of Process Injection - Part 2</title><link href="https://khushv.github.io/posts/Back-to-Basics-Process-Injection-102/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="T1055 - Basics of Process Injection - Part 2" /><published>2021-04-05T15:10:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-04-05T15:10:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://khushv.github.io/posts/Back-to-Basics-Process-Injection-102/</id> <content src="https://khushv.github.io/posts/Back-to-Basics-Process-Injection-102/" /> <author> <name>Khush V</name> </author> <category term="TTPs" /> <category term="T1055 - Process Injection" /> <summary> Back to Basics - Part 2 In the last post, part 1 of this series, we were presented with a simple Proof of Concept code for injecting shellcode into processes. In this post, we’ll continue looking at different functions and techniques that can help us be stealthier. We’ll cover remote process injections, obfuscating function calls and using ntdll function calls. 6 - Injecting into remote proce... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>T1055 - Basics of Process Injection - Part 1</title><link href="https://khushv.github.io/posts/Back-to-Basics-Process-Injection-101/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="T1055 - Basics of Process Injection - Part 1" /><published>2021-04-05T15:10:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-05-11T21:59:46+01:00</updated> <id>https://khushv.github.io/posts/Back-to-Basics-Process-Injection-101/</id> <content src="https://khushv.github.io/posts/Back-to-Basics-Process-Injection-101/" /> <author> <name>Khush V</name> </author> <category term="TTPs" /> <category term="T1055 - Process Injection" /> <summary> Introduction This guide aims to gently introduce the concepts of process injection, beginning with a naive and simple Proof of Concept code and iterating this with additional functionality such as injecting into different processes, encryption of payloads, obfuscating function calls, using DLLs &amp;amp; EXEs, unhooking and general evasion techniques. In each iteration, the aim is to introduce a n... </summary> </entry> </feed>
